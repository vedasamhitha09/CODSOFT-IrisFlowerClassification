# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The model uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and is trained on the classic Iris dataset.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains measurements for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples each from three species. The dataset includes the following features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The objective is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on these measurements.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
